Hello devs, this is simple designed recipe-finder app made in react. In main page there is a search bar where you can search for the dish and after clicking the search icon you'll see the dish containers so you can choose the dish and in the container there is a button named "Get recipe". When you click on that button you'll go to the other page where you can see the ingridients of the recipe. In the last of that page you'll see the button named "See full recipe". So when you click on that button it will take you to the website of that recipe.

API used in this web-app : "https://api.edamam.com/search?q=chicken&app_id=${YOUR_APP_ID}&app_key=${YOUR_APP_KEY}"
